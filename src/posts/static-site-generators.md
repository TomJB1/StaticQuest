Static sites are a great part of the small web. They are easy to configure, deploy, and maintain. You can use a static site generator or write the HTML yourself.

## Static Site Generators

To help some content producers, the use of a Static Site Generator is helpful. This allows the user to design their site and functionality, then just add content where it is needed and the generator builds complete HTML from template files. Examples of Static Site Generators in no particular order:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/)

There are plenty more: https://jamstack.org/generators/

Most of these generators rely on technologies like NodeJS, Python, Ruby, Go and others. The generators are able to build simple personal sites to large complex business pages, the choices are endless.

## Hosting your Static Site

Hosting a website is the next step after building it. There are many free platforms available to host a static site, and also paid hosting options. Popular static site hosting is found at:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Codeberg Pages](https://codeberg.page/)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

Many of these providers integrate with the Git actions to build and deploy the site to their hosting platform. The addition of Git provides some with a workflow that makes it easy to add their content and publish without needing to be hands on or knowledgeable in the hosting aspect of web content.

This is not a comprehensive list, but a small one to help those who wan to get into web design, blogging, and sharing their content.

## Choosing a name

Every website on the Internet is reached via a domain name. The choice provider for [Staic.Quest](https://static.quest) is [porkbun](https://porkbun.com/). They have a fun name and good prices.

If you don't want to spend a lot of money yearly, many of the hosting providers mentioned also allow you to have a subdomain off of theirs for convenience.

## What's next
